"""
Motif Memory Stub for Noor-Class Systems (v1.0.0)

Purpose:
This file provides a lightweight, no-dependency drop-in stub for the
MotifMemoryManager. It is designed for development, bootstrapping, and unit
testing where the full complexity of symbolic field logic, memory decay, and
motif dynamics is not required. It includes logging and mocking capabilities
to facilitate robust testing of dependent components.

Author: Lina Noor

RFC Compliance:
This stub provides a compatible interface for components that interact with
memory as described in the following RFCs:
- RFC-0005 ยง3: Simulates interaction with a temporally-aware motif.
- RFC-0006 ยง2: Placeholder for querying memory using swirl geometry.
- RFC-0007 ยง5: Provides a placeholder for exporting triadic structures.
